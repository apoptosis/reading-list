The Ethics of Anarcho-Capitalism
**** author
Kristopher A. Borer
**** desc
/The Ethics of Anarcho-Capitalism/ is my favourite libertarian book, if I could reccommend only a single book to goldpill a person this would be it. It is a narrative non-fiction book about libertarianism. It combines praxeology and storytelling to develop ethics in a way that is simple, robust, and fun.

Whether you want a clear introduction or a more advanced understanding, this book will shed libertarianism in a new light.

Hereâ€™s what others are saying:

This is an excellent book on anarcho-capitalism. It covers all the bases, and then some. This is an enjoyable read, an easy read, and at the end of the road lies real insight. Five stars.

#+begin_quote
This book uses praxeology to define libertarianism based on the non-aggression principle. Ancaps may find the implications disconcerting, or illuminating.

---Stephan Kinsella, author of /Against Intellectual Property/

For those who enjoy going deep into libertarian theory, the thought experiments and strategies in this book will prove valuable.
