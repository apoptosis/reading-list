* Introduction
This repo is my attempt at a [[https://reactjs.org/][React]]-based reading list built from .org source files, implementing a similar style to the image below using [[https://react-ecs.ldlework.com][react-ecs]].

* Contributing
** .org syntax

** .org -> .json
This project uses =ox-json= to export orgfiles to json to allow for easier parsing by Node, you may use any number of other packages that export to json so long as they are in a compatible format with those produced by =ox-json=.
** TS
If you make changes to this repo please do them to the TS source rather than to the JS.
